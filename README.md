Node.js+MongoDB app for tracking financial accounts, stock values, and doing market analysis.

## Description

This project is an app for users to track their own financial accounts, view current market stock values, and generate metrics and figures to aid them with market analysis. It employes the following concepts:

- Client-side routing with React Router
  - Facilitate easy and quick navigation between pages, mimicking the experience of a single-page application.
- CSS modules
  - Styles are locally-scoped to prevent potential scoping and specificity problems and keep code organized.
- Server-side routing with Express JS
  - Make the appropriate API calls to the MongoDB database depending on the URL the user visits, and send the response back to the user
  - Backend API testing via Postman to ensure that code works.
- MongoDB database
  - Ensure data persistence and allow flexible handling of data.
